My personal website, built using [Pug](https://pugjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). I will migrate
to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) when I have time to learn it and feel more comfortable with Tailwind.

Originally my site was built on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org). This was a bit overkill for my needs and very
slow, not to mention reliant on hosting and being a pain to work with. I'm rusty on front-end development, so this
serves as a good excuse to get back into it and learn some new things.

You can visit the website at [sondregronas.com](https://sondregronas.com). There's not necessarily anything interesting
there at the moment, except for a few projects and a list of my clientele just for the sake of having something there.

## Blog

I used to have a blog on my site with a few tutorials and other things, but I've decided to remove it for now as it
has not been updated in a long time. I may add it back in the future, but for now I'm focusing on other things. It was
never really a priority to begin with, and most of the content was no longer relevant either.
