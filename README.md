# sondregronas.com (WIP)
My personal website, built using [Pug](https://pugjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Currently running on Wordpress, but I'm working on migrating it to a static site (this repo), as well as a blog using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

The Wordpress instance is still available at [sondregronas.com](https://sondregronas.com).
